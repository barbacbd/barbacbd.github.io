        <h2> About Me</h2>
        Hi, my name is Brent Barbachem! I enjoy programming, surfing, rock climbing, and essentially any activity that 
        means time outdoors with family and friends. The majority of my personal programming
        projects are driven by my passion for nature. I am currently employed by Red Hat as a software engineer 
        on the Openshift Installer team. I previsouly spent time developing autonomous surface vessels and naval 
        communication systems.

                Brent was the lead developer for an autonomous surface vessel that traveled from Pensacola, FL to
                Norfolk, VA without any human intervention. The trip set numerous records for fastest and longest
                routes conducted by an autonomous surface vessel. Brent was also the lead software engineer on the 
                same project that autonomously traveled from Mobile, AL to San Diego, CA.
